## Laws

- [Conway’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)  
"organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
— M. Conway[2]  

- [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)  
Parkinson's law is the adage that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". It is also sometimes applied to the growth of the bureaucratic apparatus in an organization.  

- [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law)  
The "law" is a statement regarding the difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity.[2] It is often cited by programmers, especially in discussions of techniques to improve productivity, such as The [Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) or [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming).[3] The recursive nature of the law is a reflection of the widely experienced difficulty of estimating complex tasks despite all best efforts, including knowing that the task is complex.

## Fallacies 
- [Formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy)

- [Conjunction fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy)  
The conjunction fallacy (also known as the Linda problem) is a formal fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.
