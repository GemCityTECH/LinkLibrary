In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. It is not related to the GRASP software design principles. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin.[1][2][3] Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.[3] The theory of SOLID principles was introduced by Martin in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns,[2][4] although the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.[5]
